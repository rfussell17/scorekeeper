## ScoreKeeper



## Summary

This is a small scorekeeper app made with vanilla JS. It allows users to choose a score to play up until, and will end the game when someone reaches that number. There is also a reset button to enable the buttons to work and starts the scores at zero again.

This is one of a few vanilla JS projects that I've been making to solidify core JS concepts and familiarize myself with more built-in methods.
